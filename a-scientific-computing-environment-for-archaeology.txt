Short instructions to setup a Lubuntu Virtual Machine with
R & RStudio:

1. Download these: 
http://lubuntu.net/ (desktop cd)
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads (Oracle VM VirtualBox)

2. Install Oracle VM VirtualBox, open it (if using windows,
run as administrator), click 'New' button, at 
'Name' put Lubuntu, click 'Next' change memory size to 2048 MB (or 
more, but as a rule of thumb not more than a quarter of your total 
RAM), Click 'Next', select 'create virtual drive now', click 'Next',
select 'VDI', click 'Next', select 'Fixed size', 
click 'Next', set disk size to 8GB, click 'Create'. Feel
free to make those values larger if you like. If you can't 
set it to 8GB, set it as large as you can. 

3. At the main Oracle VM VirtualBox window, double-click on 
'Lubuntu' the VM you just set up. You will then get a little
window that asks you to 'select start-up disk', click on the
little folder icon to the right of the drop-down field, then
find where you downloaded the lubuntu desktop cd. It should
be a file that ends in iso and is about 700 MB. Once you've 
selected that file, click 'start' on the 'select start-up disk'
window. If you get an error, try turning off your antivirus
software, if that doesn't help, uninstall VirtualBox and 
download and install a new copy of VirtualBox
from here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Testbuilds

4. You will then be taken to the Lubuntu install menu, 
choose 'English' by pressing enter, then on the next
screen 'Install Lubuntu' (use the arrow keys to select, 
then press enter). Look in the lower right corner of the
window to see what button you need to press to free the
mouse (for me it's the right control key). It will take 
a few minutes to install, keep an eye on it, you will 
need to click 'continue', then 'download updates while
installing', then 'continue' again, then 'erase disk 
and install Lubuntu', then 'continue', then edit your location
then 'continue', then 'continue again (the keyboard
layout is usually fine), then type your name and password,
keep it easy and simple as this is a very low security
use (we're not using this for online banking!) and 
you'll be typing the password often. Select 'log in
automatically' then click 'continue'. Then wait a few
minutes and watch the 'copying files' progress bar.
Once that's done, it will probably want to restart,
click to accept a restart (you may have to hit enter 
a few times to move the process along), or if you 
don't get the option, click on the
little circular shutdown icon in the lower right
corner of the window, and choose 'reboot', and wait
for it to restart (hitting enter a few times if
it looks like it's stopped doing things).

5. Now open a terminal emulator window, which you 
can do by clicking on the blue button in the lower
left corner, then click on 'Accessories' then click
on 'LXTerminal'. Or you can press CTRL-ALT-t

6. At the terminal prompt, type these, one line
at a time, exactly as printed here, and press 
enter after each line (you will be prompted to 
type your password, note that you wont see 
anything on screen when you type in 
your password, no dots or asterixes - this is
normal). Once you've typed your password, press
enter. Here are the lines to type in:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11 -y

Wait for things to scroll past in the console,
it will take a few minutes. When you get your
prompt back (ie stuff stops scrolling by and 
the console is ready for a new command), restart 
your VM by clicking on the little circular 
shutdown icon in the lower right corner of 
the window, and choosing 'reboot' or you can 
type this at the terminal:

  sudo reboot

Once you're going again, look to the main 
Oracle VM VirtualBox menu bar, click on 
'Devices', then 'Shared clipboard', and set 
'Shared Clipboard' to bidirectional. 
Now you can copy and paste text to and from 
your VM.

Go back to the 'Devices' menu you were just at
and click on 'Shared folder settings...' then 
click on 'Machine Folders', then click on the
little button that is a picture of a folder
with a plus sign, that will make a little box
appear. In this box, click on the little down 
arrow at the
