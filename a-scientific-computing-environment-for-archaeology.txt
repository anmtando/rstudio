Short instructions to setup a Lubuntu Virtual Machine with
R & RStudio:

1. Download these: 
http://lubuntu.net/ (desktop cd)
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads (Oracle VM VirtualBox)

2. Install Oracle VM VirtualBox, open it, click 'New' button, at 
'Name' put Lubuntu, click 'Next' change memory size to 2048 MB, 
Click 'Next', select 'create virtual drive now', click 'Next',
select 'VDI', click 'Next', select 'Fixed size', 
click 'Next', set disk size to 8GB, click 'Create'. Feel
free to make those values larger if you like. If you can't 
set it to 8GB, set it as large as you can.

3. At the main Oracle VM VirtualBox window, double-click on 
'Lubuntu' the VM you just set up. You will then get a little
window that asks you to 'select start-up disk', click on the
little folder icon to the right of the drop-down field, then
find where you downloaded the lubuntu desktop cd. It should
be a file that ends in iso and is about 700 MB. Once you've 
selected that file, click 'start' on the 'select start-up disk'
window. 

4. You will then be taken to the Lubuntu install menu, 
choose 'English' by pressing enter, then on the next
screen 'Install Lubuntu' (use the arrow keys to select, 
then press enter). Look in the lower right corner of the
window to see what button you need to press to free the
mouse (for me it's the right control key). It will take 
a few minutes to install, keep an eye on it, you will 
need to click 'continue', then 'download updates while
installing', then 'continue' again, then 'erase disk 
and install Lubuntu', then 'continue', then edit your location
then 'continue', then 'continue again (the keyboard
layout is usually fine), then type your name and password,
keep it easy and simple as this is a very low security
use (we're not using this for online banking!) and 
you'll be typing the password often. Select 'log in
automatically' then click 'continue'. Then wait a few
minutes and watch the 'copying files' progress bar.
Once that's done click on 'reboot' and wait for it
to restart (you may have to hit enter a few times).

5. Now open a terminal emulator window, which you 
can do by clicking on the blue button in the lower
left corner, then click on 'Accessories' then click
on 'LXTerminal'. Or you can press CTRL-ALT-t

6. At the terminal prompt, type these, one line
at a line and press enter after each line (you
will be prompted to type your password, note that
you wont see anything on screen when you type in 
your password, no dots or asterixes - this is
normal). Once you've typed your password, press enter.
After a bit of activity you'll be asked if you want to
continue, type y for yes):

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install make gcc -y
  sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11 -y

Now restart your VM by clicking on the
little circular shutdown icon in the lower right
corner of the window, and choosing 'reboot'

Once you're going again, look to the menu 
bar at the top of the Oracle VM VirtualBox 
that you're working in, click on 'Devices', 
then 'Shared clipboard', and set 
'Shared Clipboard' to bidirectional. 
Now you can copy and paste text to and from 
your VM. Reboot the VM to enable this function.
  
7. Open a terminal and run these three lines 
(you can now copy and paste, so do that):

  wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benmarwick/11204658/raw/install_things.sh
  chmod +x install_things.sh
  ./install_things.sh

then press enter and wait, watching things 
scroll by. This step downloads a small script
from github and runs it. The script installs
R, RStudio, and a bunch of other things.
This will take 30+ mins, the exact time 
depends on the speed of your internet 
connection. Keep an eye on it, you'll 
need to enter your password here and 
there, and press enter once or twice. If 
know what you're doing you can download
a copy of the the script and edit it to
add or subtract items. But as it is will be
fine for most purposes. 

8. Now you're ready to compute! If you've
never used linux or the terminal before,
