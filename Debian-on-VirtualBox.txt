Short instructions to setup a Lubuntu Virtual Machine with
R & RStudio:

1. Download these: 
http://lubuntu.net/ (desktop cd)
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads (Oracle VM VirtualBox)

2. Install Oracle VM VirtualBox, open it, click 'New' button, at 
'Name' put Lubuntu, click 'Next' change memory size to 2048 MB, 
Click 'Next', select 'create virtual drive now', click 'Next',
select 'VDI', click 'Next', select 'Fixed size', 
click 'Next', set disk size to 8GB, click 'Create'. Feel
free to make those values larger if you like (but don't 
make them any smaller!). 

3. At the main Oracle VM VirtualBox window, double-click on 
'Lubuntu' the VM you just set up. You will then get a little
window that asks you to 'select start-up disk', click on the
little folder icon to the right of the drop-down field, then
find where you downloaded the lubuntu desktop cd. It should
be a file that ends in iso and is about 700 MB. Once you've 
selected that file, click 'start' on the 'select start-up disk'
window. 

4. You will then be taken to the Lubuntu install menu, 
choose 'English' by pressing enter, then on the next
screen 'Install Lubuntu' (use the arrow keys to select, 
then press enter). Look in the lower right corner of the
window to see what button you need to press to free the
mouse (for me it's the right control key). It will take 
a few minutes to install, keep an eye on it, you will 
need to click 'continue', then 'download updates while
installing', then 'continue' again, then 'erase disk 
and install Lubuntu', then 'continue', then edit your location
then 'continue', then 'continue again (the keyboard
layout is usually fine), then type your name and password,
keep it easy and simple as this is a very low security
use (we're not using this for online banking!) and 
you'll be typing the password often. Select 'log in
automatically' then click 'continue'. Then wait a few
minutes and watch the 'copying files' progress bar.
Once that's done click on 'restart' and wait for it
to restart.

5. Now open a terminal emulator window, which you 
can do by clicking on the blue button in the lower
left corner, then click on 'Accessories' then click
on 'LXTerminal'. Or you can press CTRL-ALT-t

6. At the terminal prompt, type these, one line
at a line and press enter after each line (you
will be prompted to type your password, and after
a bit of activity you'll be asked if you want to
continue, type y for yes):

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install make gcc -y
  sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11 -y
  sudo reboot
  
This last line shoud restart the program. If it 
doesn't manually restart by clicking on the
little circular shutdown icon in the lower right
corner of the window, and choose 'reboot'

Once you're going again, look to the menu 
bar at the top of the Oracle VM VirtualBox 
that you're working in, click on 'Devices', 
then 'Shared clipboard', and set 
'Shared Clipboard' to bidirectional. 
Now you can copy and paste text to and from 
your VM. 
  
7. Open a terminal and run this line 
(you can now copy and past, so do that, 
remember this is all one line):

wget -O - https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benmarwick/11204658/raw/83555f9a0b04dc1d7089335a3f1b9b78bab44e47/install_things.sh | bash

then press enter and wait, watching things 
scroll by. This will take 10+ mins, 
the exact time depends on the speed 
of your internet connection. Keep an eye
on it, you'll need to enter your password here and 
there, and press enter once or twice. 



  
  
  
  
  
  
8. Open a terminal again, then type

 sudo firefox
 
to open a web browser. Paste this URL
into the URL box :

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benmarwick/11204658/raw/94c0828fca6e56f6cee74862ac77150d6805b733/install_things.sh

and wait, watching things scroll by. This will
take 10+ mins, the exact time depends on 
the speed of your internet connection. Keep an eye
on it, you'll need to enter your password here and 
there, and press enter once or twice. 

After the page loads, in firefox click
'File' then 'Save As' and name the file as
install_things.sh in your 'Downloads' 
folder (the default location)

9. Open a second terminal and type (one line
at a time, press enter after each line)

  cd Downloads
  bash install_things.sh

and wait, watching things scroll by. This will
take 10+ mins, the exact time depends on 
the speed of your internet connection. Keep an eye
on it, you'll need to enter your password here and 
there, and press enter once or twice. 

## First download a Linux distribution: 
# Debian internet-installer image file: http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
# or
# Lubuntu, if looking for something smaller and using less memory, use the desktop cd from http://lubuntu.net/

# then download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## start VirtualBox
# Make new VM, follow prompts, set "Type: Linux" and "Version: Debian" or if using Lubuntu, "Version: Ubuntu" then ok
# at 'select start-up disk' choose the downloaded iso to make the VM from, then if using Debian, use the Debian graphic installer
# many fields can be left blank, try them and see, but DO be sure to select “Debian desktop environment”
# There are many useful guides for this (stop following when you get to the desktop, don't run any of the code in these how-tos)
# Here's a selection of how-tos (you might also search youtube)
# Mac: http://williamjturkel.net/2013/05/31/installing-debian-linux-in-a-vm/ 
# http://www.brianlinkletter.com/installing-debian-linux-in-a-virtualbox-virtual-machine/
# Windows: https://jtreminio.com/2012/07/setting-up-a-debian-vm-step-by-step/

## install guest additions (GA) to allow for copy and pasting between VM and host
# http://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm
# first open terminal and type (without #)
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install make gcc
# then at the terminal, change to the GA directory and type:
# sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run 
# then 
# sudo reboot

# Once VM has finished installing and Linux is up and running on your screen, 
# open a terminal to continue, in Debian do:

Applications -> Accessories ->Tterminal

# Or in Lubuntu do:

Button in lower left of screen -> Accessories -> LXTerminal

# see shell script below for getting things installed, read through it before running to 
# know what to expect, then copy-paste the shell script below into the text editor (gedit, leafpad etc.) on your  VM, 
# save locally on your VM, then run the shell script from the terminal by 
# typing the next line in the terminal (without the #):
# bash install_things.sh

## Other things we want to do with a VM:

# to share the entire Linux VM with others
# http://superuser.com/questions/235376/how-to-share-a-virtualbox-image
file -> export appliance

# to swap files between host OS and guest OS: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html
# and don't forget to add self to share folder: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7951

# Debian: getting in and out of su: 
# in:  su -
# out: su yourusername

# To do:

# add right-click or keyboard shortcut to 'open terminal'  cf. http://askubuntu.com/a/207448/119774 http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-gnome-open-terminal-shell-prompt-here/
