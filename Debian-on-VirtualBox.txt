Short instructions:

1. Download these: 
http://lubuntu.net/ (desktop cd)
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads (Oracle VM VirtualBox)

2. Install Oracle VM VirtualBox, open it, click 'New' button, at 
'Name' put Lubuntu, click 'Next' change memory size to 2048 MB, 
Click 'Next', select 'create virtual drive now', click 'Next',
select 'VDI', click 'Next', select 'Dynamically allocated', 
click 'Next', set disk size to , click 'Create'

3. At the main Oracle VM VirtualBox window, double-click on 
'Lubuntu' the VM you just set up. You will then get a little
window that asks you to 'select start-up disk', click on the
little folder icon to the right of the drop-down field, then
find where you downloaded the lubuntu desktop cd. It should
be a file that ends in iso and is about 700 MB. Once you've 
selected that file, click 'start' on the 'select start-up disk'
window. 

4. You will then be taken to the Lubuntu install menu, 
choose 'English' by pressing enter, then on the next
screen 'Install Lubuntu' (use the arrow keys to select, 
then press enter). Look in the lower right corner of the
window to see what button you need to press to free the
mouse (for me it's the right control key). It will take 
a few minutes to install, keep an eye on it, you will 
need to click 'continue', then 'download updates while
installing', then 'continue' again, then 'erase disk 
and install Lubuntu', then 'continue', then edit your location
then 'continue', then 'continue again (the keyboard
layout is usually fine), then type your name and password,
keep it easy and simple as this is a very low security
use (we're not using this for online banking!) and 
you'll be typing the password often. Select 'log in
automatically' then click 'continue'. Then wait a few
minutes and watch the 'copying files' progress bar.

## First download a Linux distribution: 
# Debian internet-installer image file: http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
# or
# Lubuntu, if looking for something smaller and using less memory, use the desktop cd from http://lubuntu.net/

# then download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## start VirtualBox
# Make new VM, follow prompts, set "Type: Linux" and "Version: Debian" or if using Lubuntu, "Version: Ubuntu" then ok
# at 'select start-up disk' choose the downloaded iso to make the VM from, then if using Debian, use the Debian graphic installer
# many fields can be left blank, try them and see, but DO be sure to select “Debian desktop environment”
# There are many useful guides for this (stop following when you get to the desktop, don't run any of the code in these how-tos)
# Here's a selection of how-tos (you might also search youtube)

## install guest additions (GA) to allow for copy and pasting between VM and host
# http://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm
# first open terminal and type (without #)
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install make gcc
# then at the terminal, change to the GA directory and type:
# sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run 
# then 
# sudo reboot

# Once VM has finished installing and Linux is up and running on your screen, 
# open a terminal to continue, in Debian do:

Applications -> Accessories ->Tterminal

# Or in Lubuntu do:

Button in lower left of screen -> Accessories -> LXTerminal

# see shell script below for getting things installed, read through it before running to 
# know what to expect, then copy-paste the shell script below into the text editor (gedit, leafpad etc.) on your  VM, 
# save locally on your VM, then run the shell script from the terminal by 
# typing the next line in the terminal (without the #):
# bash install_things.sh

## Other things we want to do with a VM:

# to share the entire Linux VM with others
# http://superuser.com/questions/235376/how-to-share-a-virtualbox-image
file -> export appliance

# to swap files between host OS and guest OS: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html
# and don't forget to add self to share folder: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7951

# Debian: getting in and out of su: 
# in:  su -
# out: su yourusername

# To do:

# add right-click or keyboard shortcut to 'open terminal'  cf. http://askubuntu.com/a/207448/119774 http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-gnome-open-terminal-shell-prompt-here/
