## First download a Linux distribution: 
# Debian internet-installer image file: http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
# or
# Lubuntu, if looking for something smaller and using less memory, use the desktop cd from http://lubuntu.net/

# then download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## start VirtualBox
# Make new VM, follow prompts, set "Type: Linux" and "Version: Debian" or if usuing Lubuntu, "Version: Ubuntu" then ok
# at 'select start-up disk' choose the iso to make the VM from, then if using Debian, use the Debian graphic installer
# many fields can be left blank, try them and see, but DO be sure to select “Debian desktop environment”
# There are many useful guides for this (stop following when you get to the desktop, don't run any of the code in these how-tos)
# Here's a selection of how-tos (you might also search youtube)

# install guest additions (GA) to allow for copy and pasting between VM and host
# http://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm
# first open terminal and type (wuthout #)
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install make gcc
# then at the terminal, change to the GA directory and type:
# sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run 
# then 
# sudo reboot

# Once VM has finished installing and Linux is up and running on your screen, in Debian do:

Applications -> accessories -> terminal

# see shell script below for getting things installed, read through it before running to 
# know what to expect, then copy-paste the shell script below into the text editor (gedit, leafpad etc.) on your  VM, 
# save locally on your VM, then run the shell script from the terminal by 
# typing the next line in the terminal (without the #):
# bash install_things.sh

## Other things we want to do with a VM:

# to share the entire Debian VM with others
# http://superuser.com/questions/235376/how-to-share-a-virtualbox-image
file -> export appliance

# to swap files between host OS and guest OS: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html
# and don't forget to add self to share folder: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7951

# getting in and out of su: 
# in:  su -
# out: su yourusername

# To do:

# add right-click or keyboard shortcut to 'open terminal'  cf. http://askubuntu.com/a/207448/119774 http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-gnome-open-terminal-shell-prompt-here/
