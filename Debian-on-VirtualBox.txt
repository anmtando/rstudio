# using the 64-bit desktop cd from http://lubuntu.net/

# then
# Oracle VM VirtualBox (and install): https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

# start VirtualBox and mount Debian netinstall iso
# Make new VM, follow prompts, use Debian graphic installer
# many fields can be left blank, try them and see, but DO be sure to select “Debian desktop environment”
# There are many useful guides for this (stop following when you get to the desktop, don't run any of the code in these how-tos)

# install guest additions to allow for copy and pasting between VM and host
# http://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm
# first do sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get install make gcc
# I used sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run then sudo reboot

# Once VM has finished installing and Debain is up and running on your screen, in Debian do:

Applications -> accessories -> terminal

# see shell script below for getting R & RSutdio installed, read through it before running to 
# know what to expect, then copy-paste the shell script below into gedit on your Debian VM, 
# save locally on your Debian VM, then run the shell script from the terminal by 
# typing the next line in the terminal (minus the #):
# bash install_R.sh


# Other things we want to do with a VM:

# to share the entire Debian VM with others
