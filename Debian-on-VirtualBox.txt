# Make new VM, follow prompts, use Debian graphic installer
# many fields can be left blank, try them and see, but DO be sure to select “Debian desktop environment”

Applications -> accessories -> terminal

# see shell script below for getting R & RSutdio installed, read through it before running to

# save locally on your Debian VM, then run the shell script from the terminal by 
# typing the next line in the terminal (minus the #):
# bash install_R.sh


# Other things we want to do with a VM:

# to share the entire Debian VM with others
